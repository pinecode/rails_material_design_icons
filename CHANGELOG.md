## Changes

## [6.5.95] - 2021-12-01

- Going to follow Material Design Icon versioning for this gem to make it easier to know when to update it. 
- Which means that the version of Material Design Icons and this gem are both now at 6.5.95.
- Added `mdi` helper method, since mdi_icon (Material Design Icon icon) was bit of an oxymore.
- Added `mdi_spin` helper method that adds the spin class for your icon. 
## [0.7.0] - 2021-06-08

- Was including some unnecessary files in the gem package. So the size of this gem should be a bit smaller now. 
Also updated required Ruby version to 2.5 to be a bit more realistic. 

# Version 0.6.0
-Actually fix CSS not being found. 

## Note that versions before 0.6.0 don't actually contain the fonts unless you use this gem from git. 

# Version 0.5.0
-Fix CSS not being found. 

# Version 0.4.0
-Fix license on Rubygems
# Version 0.3
-Fix Github address and order of version numbers for gem bump command. 

# Version 0.2 
-Second version, helpers were not working, so fixed that. Also the name Material Design Icons Rails was already in use on RubyGems, so Rails Material Design Icons it is. 

# Version 0.1
-The first test release. Material Design Icons version 5.4.55.
